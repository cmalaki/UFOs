# UFOs

## Overview
In this module, we modified an html file using Javascript and HTML, creating filters and functions to loop through datasets while keeping the search results that match criteria. 

## Summary

We created four elements: city, state, country, and shape, to allow us to search these elements and keep track of changes. This will allow Dana to use her webpage by filtering data based on given criteria. 

## Results
This dataset would not be very functional for someone who is not extremely familiar with dataset, as you must know what to search for. It is useful to allow us to use filtering processes to find and explore data more easily.
